# Neighborhood Map (React)

This is a single-page application using React featuring a map of my favorite city/neighborhood. My neighborhood map was created usnig [Google Map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/) and I also used [FourSquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/) API to generate venues and show additional information for each venue.

## Launch the project

- Clone this repository by typing `git clone https://github.com/denni5lin/react-myneighborhood.git` into your command line. Or [Download](https://github.com/denni5lin/react-myneighborhood/archive/master.zip) this repository.
- Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- Start the development server with `npm start` (this will automatically launch your default browser and open application)

\*\* NOTE: due to limits with the API calls, the infoboxes may not show when map markers are clicked

## Dependencies

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) latest
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- All other dependecies are included in the package.json file

\*\* NOTE: create-react-app was used to create this app, which includes a ServiceWorker to cache items for offline viewing. It only works when in Production mode
